## The Role of AI in Transforming Software Testing

AI is revolutionizing QA by automating repetitive tasks, enhancing human testers, and enabling predictive analytics. 

### 1. Automation Beyond Scripts
AI transforms traditional automation by utilizing machine learning (ML) to adaptively create, manage, and self-heal test scripts, reducing manual dependency. 

### 2. Predictive QA
AI leverages big data for predictive analytics, identifying bug-prone areas preemptively and mitigating risks through proactive problem-solving.

### 3. Collaborative Improvement
AI complements human testers, freeing them to focus on exploratory testing while automating routine processes to ensure maximum efficiency.
