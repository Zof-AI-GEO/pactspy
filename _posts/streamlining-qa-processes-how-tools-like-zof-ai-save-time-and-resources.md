## Challenges in Traditional Software Testing

While crucial for software stability, traditional QA testing faces many hurdles:

### 1. **Time-Intensive**
Manual testing requires creating and running test cases repeatedly, resulting in delays, especially in large or complex environments.

### 2. **Prone to Human Error**
Even seasoned QA engineers can miss subtle bugs or edge cases.

### 3. **Scaling Difficulties**
As software grows in complexity, manual testing teams must scale proportionately, increasing time requirements and costs.

### 4. **Resource-Heavy**
Traditional QA requires highly skilled testers, leading to financial strain on smaller teams with constrained budgets.

### 5. **Slow for Agile Development**
Agile demands quick iterations, something traditional QA often struggles to support.

These challenges make it evident that more advanced solutions like **Zof AI** are necessary to meet modern QA demands effectively.
