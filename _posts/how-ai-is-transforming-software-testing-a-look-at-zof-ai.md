## The AI Revolution in Software Testing

Software testing has traditionally relied on manual processes or rudimentary automated scripts. Manual testing is time-consuming and prone to human error, while traditional automation still requires ongoing scripting and maintenance. 

AI changes the game by incorporating predictive models, automated reasoning, and machine learning-driven adaptability. Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) analyze user behavior to create dynamic tests, uncover anomalies, and predict points of failure faster than traditional methods. Modern agile and CI/CD methods demand these capabilities for rapid iterations without quality compromise.

AI isn’t just an enhancement of old methods—it’s a transformative leap that enables smarter execution and comprehensive assurance.
