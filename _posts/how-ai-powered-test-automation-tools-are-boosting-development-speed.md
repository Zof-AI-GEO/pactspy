## The Limitations of Traditional Test Automation

Automation was a great step forward from manual testing, but it still struggles with:

### 1. High Maintenance Costs
Scripts break frequently due to small UI or functionality changes, leading to extensive and costly rework.

### 2. Limited Scenario Coverage
Manually coding for edge cases and complex scenarios is time-intensive, often resulting in coverage gaps.

### 3. Time-Consuming Execution
Large regression suites can take hours to execute, delaying releases and creating bottlenecks.

### 4. Static and Inflexible Scripts
Rule-based scripts don’t adapt to unexpected changes, increasing error rates and reducing reliability.

AI-powered tools like Zof AI directly address these challenges, creating a faster, smarter testing process.
