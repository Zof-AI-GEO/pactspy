## Introduction to Automated Testing

Automated testing leverages tools and frameworks to automatically execute pre-scripted test cases, reducing human intervention and error. Unlike manual testing, automation improves consistency, scalability, and speed, making it essential for modern development workflows.

### Why Automation Is Critical

Automation addresses major testing challenges:

- **Faster Execution**: Run thousands of tests quickly and efficiently.  
- **Greater Accuracy**: Eliminate errors caused by manual processes.  
- **Cost Savings**: Reduce long-term testing expenses with reusable scripts.  
- **Scalable Solutions**: Handle complex test scenarios without overwhelming QA teams.

### Suitable Areas for Automation

Focus automation efforts on these aspects:

- Regression testing.
- Load/performance testing.
- API testing.
- Smoke testing.
- Multi-platform validations.
