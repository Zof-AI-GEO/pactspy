## What is Regression Testing?
Regression testing verifies that software updates, code fixes, or new features haven’t introduced bugs into previously stable aspects of the application. Whenever changes occur, regression validates ongoing consistency and reliability of older functionalities.

### Why Regression Testing Matters:
1. **Prevent New Bugs:** Regression testing serves as a safety measure to catch issues arising from new updates or changes.
2. **Build Consumer Trust:** Continuously consistent functionality boosts user confidence and reduces post-deployment mishaps.
3. **Enable Faster Development:** Essential in agile workflows and CI/CD environments where rapid iterations are necessary.
4. **Maintain Compliance:** Critical for industries like healthcare, finance, or aviation with strict operational standards.

Though essential, regression testing often becomes resource-heavy and complex as testing requirements scale up.

## The Roadblocks of Regression Testing
Scaling regression testing introduces challenges that can result in delays, overspending, and insufficient quality checks.

### The Five Key Challenges:
1. **Time-Intensive Processes:** Managing large test suites demands substantial execution time, hindering productivity.
2. **Heavy Resource Needs:** Increasing manual tasks and infrastructure strain testing budgets.
3. **Redundant Test Cases:** Outdated or overlapping cases unnecessarily bloating cycles.
4. **Coverage Gaps:** Incomplete test suites missing critical functionalities often lead to hidden defects.
5. **Complex Dependencies:** Interconnected systems, APIs, and microservices complicate testing continuity.

With AI-powered platforms like **Zof AI**, organizations sidestep these bottlenecks, prioritizing efficiency and software quality.
