## How AI is Transforming Software Testing

Traditional QA relied on manual processes, static test cases, and human-driven efforts that were resource-heavy and error-prone. AI overcomes these limitations through:

- **Machine Learning:** Predict defects and dynamically generate test scenarios based on data.
- **Automation:** Optimize repetitive tasks and testing cycles for efficiency.
- **Data Analysis:** Identify patterns to proactively eliminate risks.

AI innovations, such as [Zof AI](https://zof.ai), empower businesses to save time and deploy applications with greater accuracy and confidence.
