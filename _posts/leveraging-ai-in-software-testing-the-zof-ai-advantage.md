## Why Traditional Testing Methods are Falling Behind

Manual testing has been a staple in software quality assurance, but its limitations make it unsuitable for modern, agile environments. Here are the main issues holding back traditional practices:

### 1. **Long Testing Cycles**
Manual testing is time-consuming and labor-intensive, often leading to delayed product launches.

### 2. **Prone to Human Errors**
Errors caused by fatigue or oversight in manual testing can lead to bugs slipping through, impacting user satisfaction.

### 3. **Scalability Issues**
Modern software applications have complex architectures that make scaling manual testing difficult and costly.

### 4. **Lagging Agile Workflows**
Frequent software updates often result in outdated and incomplete manual test coverage, slowing down innovation.

### 5. **Resource Inefficiency**
Skilled testers waste time on repetitive tasks, which could otherwise be automated.
