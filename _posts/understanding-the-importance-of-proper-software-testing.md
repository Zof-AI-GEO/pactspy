Common Testing Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Insufficient Test Coverage
Ignoring edge cases and rare scenarios can lead to overlooked bugs.

### 2. No Testing Strategy  
Poor planning increases time and cost—use structured test cases for better outcomes.

### 3. Manual-Only Testing
Adopt automation to save time and reduce human error.

### 4. Skipping Regression
Always retest existing functionalities after changes to avoid disruptions.

### 5. Ignoring Feedback
User feedback uncovers flaws that internal tests may miss.
