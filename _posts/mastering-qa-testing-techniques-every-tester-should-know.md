## Manual Testing: Timeless QA Techniques 

Manual testing remains an invaluable pillar of QA, allowing in-depth exploration of software behavior. Here are essential techniques QA testers should master:

- **Exploratory Testing:** Innovative, on-the-go testing to uncover edge cases and unexpected outcomes.
- **Boundary Value Analysis:** Detect defects at input limit ranges.
- **Equivalence Partitioning:** Streamline testing by focusing on grouped input classes.
- **Negative Testing:** Simulate invalid data inputs to assess software robustness.
- **UI Testing:** Validate that user interface elements are functional and visually accurate.
- **Regression Testing:** Regularly evaluate after code changes to maintain software reliability.
