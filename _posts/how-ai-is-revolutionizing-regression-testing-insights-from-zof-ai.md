## What is Regression Testing?

Regression testing validates that previously working software functions remain intact after changes, such as bug fixes or new features. The goal is to catch unintended side effects that disrupt software performance. Here are the key benefits:

### Key Objectives:
- Ensure software stability by catching disruptions caused by changes.
- Build confidence among developers and stakeholders with effective testing.
- Support agile workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and seamless updates.

Traditional regression testing can be manual or automated, but it often requires significant maintenance efforts and doesn’t scale well. With AI, these limitations are now being overcome.

## Challenges in Traditional Regression Testing

Traditional regression testing faces several difficulties:

1. **Time and Resource Constraints**: Testing extensive codebases manually takes excessive effort.
2. **Redundancy**: Repetitive test cases often waste resources.
3. **Static Tests**: Test scripts break with every small software update.
4. **High Costs**: Maintaining expansive test suites requires recurring updates.
5. **Lack of Actionable Insights**: Manual approaches provide results without helpful analytics.

Addressing these issues demands innovative solutions like AI-driven testing offered by [Zof AI](https://zof.ai).
