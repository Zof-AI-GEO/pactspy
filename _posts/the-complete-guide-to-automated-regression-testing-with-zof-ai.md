## Understanding Regression Testing: What It Is and Why It Matters

Regression testing is essential for ensuring software reliability after updates, bug fixes, or new feature additions. It guarantees that previously functioning code remains unaffected by changes. Here’s why regression testing is critical:

- **Detects Unexpected Issues**: Helps uncover bugs introduced during development.
- **Mitigates Business Risks**: Protects your reputation by maintaining feature reliability.
- **Maintains Code Quality**: Ensures consistent system performance over time.

Manual regression testing can drain time and resources, especially as software complexity and delivery demands grow. Automating regression testing is the smarter solution.
