## Why Software Testing Matters

Software testing ensures product integrity by validating functionality, detecting bugs, and identifying vulnerabilities. Without effective QA methods, developers risk releasing flawed software that could harm user trust, impact operational costs, or cause reputational damage. 

Traditional manual testing is thorough but time-consuming, while automated testing improves efficiency—albeit with rigid scripting and repetitive maintenance requirements. AI-powered tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) now tackle these challenges with intelligent automation, ensuring precise, adaptable, and scalable testing solutions for modern applications.
