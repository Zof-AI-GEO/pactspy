## AI’s Journey in Software Testing

Historically, testing was manual, requiring human testers to perform labor-intensive workflows. The advent of automation tools like Selenium made significant strides in improving efficiency. However, these tools were still reliant on human scripting and configuration, presenting limitations in terms of scalability and error-handling capabilities.

AI emerged as a game-changer, initially offering predictive analytics to identify flaky tests or vulnerable areas. Today, advanced AI-powered tools like **Zof AI** are transforming the landscape further. From autonomous test case execution to intelligent error detection and real-time test maintenance, AI has pushed software testing beyond mere automation to intelligent automation.
