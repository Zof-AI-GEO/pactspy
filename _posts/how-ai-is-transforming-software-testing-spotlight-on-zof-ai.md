## The Challenges in Traditional Software Testing

Despite advancements, traditional testing faces ongoing roadblocks that hinder productivity, escalate costs, and jeopardize software reliability. Let’s explore these challenges:

### 1. Labor-Intensive Manual Testing
Manual testing involves tiresome effort, juggling multiple scenarios to address permutations. It’s time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical for complex applications—resulting in extended timelines and inflated costs.

### 2. Limited Scalability
Automated testing demands predefined scripts, requiring constant updates with evolving features. Building and maintaining these scripts delays progress within agile environments. 

### 3. Oversight in Edge Cases
Traditional approaches struggle to cover rare, real-world edge cases, leading to overlooked bugs that degrade the end-user experience.

### 4. Delayed Deliveries
Testing confined to the lifecycle’s end often reveals issues too late, delaying releases. Continuous integration between testing and development is often insufficient.
