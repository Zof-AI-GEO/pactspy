## Challenges in Traditional Software Testing

### 1. Susceptibility to Human Errors
Manual testing often involves repetitive processes prone to oversight. With vast software architectures, even experienced testers may miss bugs. 

### 2. Insufficient Scalability
Growing applications stretch the limits of traditional testing. Manual approaches can’t keep up, causing project delays and burdening teams.

### 3. Time-Consuming Execution
Crafting and running test cases manually consumes precious time. Teams spend weeks on tasks that AI and automation could complete in days.

### 4. Inconsistent Test Coverage
It’s difficult for traditional testing to ensure robust coverage, potentially leaving gaps that may lead to critical bugs post-launch.

### 5. Inadequate Speed for Agile Development
With agile methodologies emphasizing swift software iterations, traditional testing hinders progress due to its slow, outdated processes.
