Common Pitfalls to Avoid in Automated Testing

Avoid these mistakes for smoother automation success:

### 1. Over-Automating Test Cases
Automating every case is impractical. Focus on high-priority objectives.

**Solution**: Perform cost-benefit analysis before automating.

### 2. Neglecting Script Maintenance
Broken scripts quickly reduce efficiency.

**Solution**: Use tools like Zof AI that offer self-healing automation.

### 3. Ignoring Test Data Quality
Faulty data compromises test accuracy.

**Solution**: Use stable, isolated test datasets.

### 4. Limiting Automation to UI Tests
UI tests alone cannot fully validate an application.

**Solution**: Include API and backend tests for broader coverage.

### 5. Unrealistic Timelines
Rushing automation leads to mistakes and compromises quality.

**Solution**: Educate stakeholders on realistic automation timelines.
