## Why Traditional Bug Detection Methods Fall Short

Bug detection is a critical part of the software development lifecycle, but it encounters several challenges that hinder efficiency and accuracy:

### 1. **Manual Testing Can Be Error-Prone**
Manual testing depends on human effort and intuition, often leading to oversight—especially under tight deadlines.

### 2. **Static Test Suites Lack Flexibility**
Static test suites fail to uncover bugs emerging from dynamic code interactions, leaving vulnerabilities in production.

### 3. **Time-Consuming Process**
Manual bug detection is labor-intensive, stretching the development cycle and introducing delays to project completion.

### 4. **Inadequate Coverage**
Testing procedures may overlook edge cases, allowing bugs to slip into production and causing potential disruptions.
