## Introduction to Automated Software Testing

Automated software testing streamlines the process of executing pre-defined test cases using scripts and specialized tools, eliminating manual oversight. Key benefits include reduced human errors, consistent results, and faster workflows. However, the dramatic evolution of modern software — including cloud computing, IoT, and microservices — has outpaced the capabilities of traditional automation tools.

AI-enhanced software testing integrates machine intelligence to deliver smarter, adaptive solutions for dynamic testing environments. AI systems analyze data, predict outcomes, and proactively address issues in ways conventional tools cannot. This translates to higher efficiency and improved software quality.
