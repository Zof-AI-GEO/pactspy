## Importance of QA in Software Development

QA plays a pivotal role in releasing robust software products. Beyond code production, quality assurance ensures functionality, stability, and compliance.

Key advantages of QA include:

1. **Early Issue Detection**: Catch and resolve bugs, security gaps, and performance challenges early.
2. **Optimized User Experience**: Deliver smooth and reliable user interactions.
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Solving issues earlier avoids higher post-launch costs.
4. **Regulatory Adherence**: In industries where compliance is mandatory, QA ensures conformity to standards.

However, traditional QA methods are resource-intensive and prone to human error—making innovative solutions like Zof AI indispensable.
