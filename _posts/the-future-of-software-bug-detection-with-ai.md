## The Evolution of Software Testing Tools
Early debugging methods involved painstaking manual processes, suitable only for small-scale programs. As software complexity grew, automated testing platforms like JUnit, Selenium, and LoadRunner emerged to streamline test execution. However, challenges such as unanticipated bugs, scalability testing, and time-consuming runtime evaluations persist. These gaps called for a smarter approach powered by dynamic AI-driven innovation.
