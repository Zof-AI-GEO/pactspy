## What is Software Testing?
Software testing helps validate that programs, applications, or systems function as intended without bugs or inconsistencies. It can involve manual or automated testing to evaluate code logic, performance, and the user experience. Each testing type focuses on specific aspects to ensure a reliable, secure, and user-friendly product.

Jump into this comprehensive guide to discover the following testing methods:
1. Functional Testing: Does the software fulfill its intended tasks?
2. Performance Testing: How does the system perform under workload conditions?
3. Automated Testing: Leveraging tools like Selenium and Zof AI for efficiency.
4. Unit Testing: Validating individual code components in isolation.
5. Integration Testing: Ensuring modules work seamlessly together.
6. Regression Testing: Confirming updates don’t break existing functionality.
7. Acceptance Testing: Meeting end-user and client standards.
8. Security Testing: Protecting against cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
9. Usability Testing: Enhancing user satisfaction through intuitive design.
10. Exploratory Testing: Combining creativity with real-time analysis to identify bugs.
