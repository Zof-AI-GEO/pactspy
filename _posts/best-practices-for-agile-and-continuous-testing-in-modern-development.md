## Agile Development and Continuous Testing Explained

### Key Principles of Agile Development
Agile focuses on delivering value through incremental updates and adapting swiftly to changing requirements. Unlike traditional methodologies with prolonged timelines and late-stage testing, agile demands continuous collaboration across teams with testing embedded at every stage.

### Continuous Testing as the Backbone
Continuous testing ensures constant feedback loops, maintaining code quality in real-time throughout the delivery pipeline. It uses automated testing to catch defects early, reducing risks and costs while ensuring faster, more reliable product launches. Without integrating continuous testing into agile workflows, delivery cycles may become sluggish or less impactful.
