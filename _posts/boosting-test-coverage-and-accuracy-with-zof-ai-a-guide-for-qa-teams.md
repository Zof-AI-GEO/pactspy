## The Importance of Test Coverage and Accuracy

### What is Test Coverage?
Test coverage reflects how thoroughly an application's features, code, and integrations are tested. High coverage ensures validated functionality across frontend, backend, APIs, and more, minimizing the risk of bugs in production.

### Why is Accuracy Crucial?
Testing accuracy ensures that tests identify actual issues without false positives or negatives. False positives lead to wasted debugging efforts, while false negatives create risks of undetected bugs.

**The Downsides of Poor Test Coverage and Accuracy:**
- **Degraded user experience.**
- **Increased production issues.**
- **Higher maintenance costs.**
- **Diminished customer trust.**

Great test coverage results in robust reliability and stakeholder confidence. Yet, achieving top-tier coverage and accuracy is easier with cutting-edge solutions like Zof AI.
