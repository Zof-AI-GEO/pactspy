## 1. Key Software Testing Challenges and Their Impact

Software testing is fraught with challenges that can disrupt workflows and compromise software quality:

- **Inadequate Test Coverage**: Rapid development cycles can hinder comprehensive test coverage.
- **Resource Constraints**: Teams often operate under tight budgets and timelines.
- **Unclear Requirements**: Ambiguity in project requirements impacts the accuracy of testing.
- **Dynamic Software Environments**: Frequent updates demand adaptive testing strategies.

Advanced tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) address these challenges with test automation and AI-powered insights.
