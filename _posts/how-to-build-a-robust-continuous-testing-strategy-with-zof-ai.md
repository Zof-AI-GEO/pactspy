## What is Continuous Testing?

Continuous testing automates testing processes at every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring each code change is validated in real-time. Its advantages include:

- Discovering issues earlier
- Mitigating risks associated with releases
- Speeding up feedback loops
- Consistently excellent user experiences

Rather than postponing testing to the post-development phase, continuous testing integrates testing alongside development workflows. It encompasses unit tests, functional tests, integration tests, and performance evaluations for end-to-end quality assurance.

### Key Features of Continuous Testing

- **Automation-Driven:** Automation replaces repetitive manual testing for better scalability and speed.
- **Feedback-Focused:** Immediate feedback ensures quicker issue resolution and informed decision-making.
- **Integrated with Development:** Test workflows align seamlessly with the CI/CD process, driving consistently high-quality deployments.

This approach is essential for supporting CI/CD pipelines in modern DevOps environments.

## How CI/CD Pipelines Enable Continuous Testing

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines automate software development workflows, underpinning seamless continuous testing. Here's how they work:

### **Continuous Integration (CI):**
- Developers commit code changes to a shared repository.
- Automated tests verify every new addition, reducing integration errors.

### **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
- Automates deployment readiness by validating updates through robust tests.

While effective, maintaining streamlined pipelines demands advanced solutions like Zof AI to optimize testing performance and reliability.
