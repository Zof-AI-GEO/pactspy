## Key Challenges Blocking Full Test Coverage

Achieving adequate test coverage requires time, collaboration, and deep technical understanding, which are often in short supply. Key obstacles include:

1. **Time Pressures:** Tight deadlines force compromises in testing rigor.
2. **Knowledge Silos:** Developers and QA may miss edge cases due to incomplete understanding of new features.
3. **Application Complexity:** Modern architectures and APIs introduce nuanced behaviors that can be overlooked.
4. **Changing Requirements:** Evolving software features lead to coverage gaps missed without automated tracking.
5. **Collaboration Gaps:** Miscommunication between teams can lead to redundant or missing test cases.

Zof AI resolves these issues with AI-powered efficiency and automation, enabling teams to optimize test strategies while minimizing effort.
