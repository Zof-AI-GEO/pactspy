## Manual Testing: Definition and Use Cases

### What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing requires human interaction, where a tester executes test cases and evaluates results without automation tools. It focuses on:
- Detecting bugs and UX issues through intuition.
- Assessing app usability and visually analyzing software behavior.
- Testing scenarios that may not be programmable.

### When to Opt for Manual Testing

Manual testing is invaluable in situations requiring creativity, judgment, or flexibility. Recommended use cases include:

1. **Exploratory Testing**: During ongoing app changes, manual testers can uncover edge cases.
2. **UI & UX Validation**: Gauging visual and interactive elements needs human perception for perfection.
3. **Small-Scale Projects**: For shorter projects, manual testing often saves initial setup time.
4. **Ad-Hoc Bug Testing**: Investigate surprise issues immediately with manual analysis.
5. **Localization Validation**: Ensure regional formatting and cultural relevance fit diverse audiences.

While effective, manual testing can be time-intensive, error-prone, and unsuitable for repetitive tasks—which is where automated testing thrives.
