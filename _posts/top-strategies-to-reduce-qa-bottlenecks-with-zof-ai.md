## Major QA Bottlenecks Impacting Teams

Understanding key QA pain points is the first step toward improvement. Let’s identify common bottlenecks that impede testing efficiency:

### 1. **Incomplete Test Coverage**
Limited resources and strict schedules often restrict test coverage, leaving potential bugs undetected.

### 2. **Overreliance on Manual Testing**
Manual processes slow down workflows and are prone to human error.

### 3. **Insufficient Collaboration Across Teams**
A lack of synchronization between QA, development, and operations splits priorities and slows progress.

### 4. **Time-Consuming Regression Testing**
Regression testing safeguards older functionalities but is labor-intensive and delays critical releases.

### 5. **Tool Integration Issues**
Fragmented testing tools and systems create inefficiencies, delaying timelines.
