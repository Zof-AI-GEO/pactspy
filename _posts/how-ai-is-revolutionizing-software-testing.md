## The Rise of AI in Software Testing

AI's integration into software testing has reshaped traditional processes. Previous methods relied heavily on manual testing or basic automation tools like Selenium or JUnit, demanding extensive human input. AI tools now use machine learning (ML) algorithms and predictive analytics to analyze data, detect patterns, and predict potential failures—often without direct human involvement. Progressive tools such as **Zof AI** have revolutionized testing further by introducing self-learning qualities, enabling these solutions to adapt to codebase changes dynamically.

Advanced tools like Zof AI provide intelligent test case generation, automated defect detection, and efficient regression testing. AI has moved software testing from reactive to proactive, increasing efficiency and reducing human effort.
