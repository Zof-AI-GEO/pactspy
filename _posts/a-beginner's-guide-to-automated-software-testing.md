## What is Automated Software Testing?

Automated software testing involves using specialized tools and scripts to perform tests on software applications, eliminating the need for repetitive, manual testing. Instead of executing tests manually, automated testing programs handle tedious and time-intensive tasks, allowing testers to concentrate on resolving complex challenges.

### Key Automation Testing Scenarios:

- **Regression Testing**: Rechecking existing functionality after modifications.
- **Performance Testing**: Measuring system performance under specific conditions.
- **Load Testing**: Simulating high-volume user traffic to test app capabilities.
- **Functional Testing**: Confirming that software features work as planned with desired results.

Automation enhances accuracy, saves valuable time, and complements manual testing by managing tedious but critical aspects of test execution. Choosing the right tools, strategy, and frameworks underpins success in automated testing.
