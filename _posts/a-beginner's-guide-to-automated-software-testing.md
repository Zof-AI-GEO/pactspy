## Why Use Automated Software Testing?
Testing the same application cases repeatedly can lead to human error and resource exhaustion. Automated software testing addresses these issues by running pre-defined test cases automatically and consistently. For example, testing all functions of an e-commerce website manually after every update would take hours, but automation cuts that down to minutes.
