## Agile Testing: Key Principles and Challenges

Agile testing integrates seamlessly into development workflows, focusing on continuous feedback, flexibility, automation, and collaboration. While agile testing methodologies are robust, complex software systems demand advanced solutions like AI for improved results.

### Core Agile Testing Principles
- **Continuous Feedback**: Tests run iteratively in sync with development cycles to ensure instant validation.
- **Automation**: Routine tasks such as regression testing are automated to save time.
- **Flexibility**: Quick adaptation to changes keeps testing aligned with evolving requirements.
- **Collaboration**: Unified efforts among testers, developers, and stakeholders drive testing efficiency.

Understanding the intersection of agile methodologies and AI is key to overcoming persistent QA challenges.
